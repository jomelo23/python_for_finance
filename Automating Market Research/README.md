This is a folder for storing Python for Finance project. This was an interesting project to continue to develop my python skills. This will be in three parts:

1. Automating Market Research with Yahoo Finance and MarketBeat

2. Portfolio Optimisation (Markowitz, MPT and Black-Litterman); The Warrent Buffet example

3. Python-based Dashboard for an Investment Portfolio
